# billboard_100
This script takes an input of a date in the past, scrapes the billboard hot 100 songs on that day from the [Billboard website](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/) and creates a Spotify playlist.

To use this script to make a playlist on your own Spotify account, you need to register for the Spotify API and replace the client id and client secret variables with your own credentials.
